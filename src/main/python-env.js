 * Python interpreter discovery + the app-managed venv.

 * that decision is confined to this file: to switch to a bundled interpreter
 * later, only `findSystemPython()` has to change (return the bundled path) and
 * the rest of the app is unaffected.
 *
 * The venv lives under userData, is owned entirely by the app, and is where the
 * onboarding screen's torch install lands - runner.py runs *inside* it, so the

 * takes the whole app down and forces a rebuild - creating the environment,

 * So instead of removing everything and putting half of it back, remove only the
 * half we mean: torch, transformers, diffusers and every package that came in with
 * them. `uv pip sync` does this exactly - it makes the environment match the given
 * list and uninstalls whatever is not in it, orphaned transitive dependencies
 * included, which a plain `uv pip uninstall torch` would leave behind.
 *
 * Two details that are easy to get wrong:
 *   - sync wants a fully-resolved list, not a top-level one. Handed SERVER_DEPS
 *     directly it uninstalls starlette out from under fastapi. Hence the compile.
 *   - `uv` itself must be in the list. It is not a SERVER_DEP, so sync would
 *     happily uninstall it - and on Windows that means deleting the running
 *     uv.exe that is doing the uninstalling.
