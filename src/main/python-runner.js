/**
 * The Python engine, as a child process.
 *
 * Replaces the FastAPI/uvicorn sidecar. Instead of binding a port and speaking
 * HTTP to itself over loopback, the engine is now a plain child process that we
 * talk to in newline-delimited JSON over its stdin/stdout (see python/runner.py
 * for the protocol). Nothing listens on the network, so nothing on the machine
 * can reach the engine except this process.
 *
 * `call()` returns a promise per request id; long operations also stream
 * `progress` frames, which is how model downloads and the runtime install
 * report back without polling. Unsolicited `event` frames (hardware ticks,
 * store changes) are broadcast to whoever subscribed.
 *
 * The engine is restarted lazily rather than eagerly: if it dies (OOM during a
 * 7B load is the realistic case), every in-flight promise rejects with a real
 * message and the *next* call spawns a fresh one. Eager respawning would fight
 * a crash loop.
