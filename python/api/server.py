"""The local HTTP API - the one thing ZeroInfer deliberately exposes.

This is an *optional* listener bolted onto the side of the engine. The desktop
app does not use it and never talks to it: the window is a local file driven over
stdio, so the UI works whether this is running or not. Turning it on adds exactly
one capability - other programs on this machine can drive your loaded models.

What it serves
--------------
  /v1/*     OpenAI-compatible. Point LangChain / the OpenAI SDK here.
  /api/*    Six endpoints, and only the six the MCP server calls.

What it does NOT serve
----------------------
The app's interface. There is no static mount, no index.html, nothing to render.
Pointing a browser at the root gets a 404 and always will - this file has no way
to hand out the UI even if someone asked it to. That is the difference from the
old web build, where the same port served both the API and the whole application.

Security posture
----------------
  - binds 127.0.0.1 only, never 0.0.0.0. It is not reachable from your network.
  - sends no CORS headers, so a web page you visit cannot *read* a response from
    it, even though it can technically issue a request.
  - exposes no token/credential route. `/api/hf/token` existed on the old server
    and is deliberately not here: any local process could have read your
    HuggingFace token out of it.

It is still unauthenticated, which means any process running as you can use it.
That is the same trade Ollama makes, and it is why this is a setting the user
turns on rather than something that is simply always listening.
